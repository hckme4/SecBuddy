# SecBuddy
System Administration made simple.

**What is SecBuddy?**</br>
SecBuddy is the "SysAdmin's best friend" (dogs count too... :P), and consists of a series of bash scripts to aid in configuring</br>
and securing your system. On top of this, it's all in bash and with some minimal tuning it can be made to support any Linux </br>
distribution. This tool is NOT a substitute for an actual system administrator, it just automates the most tedious tasks of </br>
the job- installing upates, creating backups, creating users, etc.</br>
</br>
On top of this, SecBuddy comes with tools to simplify setting up a firewall, creation of jailed enironments, and more.
